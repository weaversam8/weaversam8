### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Sam Weaver](https://samweaver.com)! I'm a student and a software engineer based out of Raleigh, North Carolina! ðŸŒ³

âœ¨ I have a passion solving problems in the spaces of **productivity, community, and education.** You can learn more about my professional focus areas [on my website](https://samweaver.com/work/)!

I'm not currently maintaining any major open source projects, but I try to contribute back (usually in the form of issues, bug reports, and documentation) to the projects I use when I can. Feel free to reach out to me via [my website](https://samweaver.com/me/) (look for the link that reads "Get in touch").
