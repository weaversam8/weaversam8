### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Sam Weaver](https://samweaver.com)! I'm a student and a software engineer based out of Raleigh, North Carolina! ðŸŒ³

âœ¨ I have a passion for solving problems in the spaces of **productivity, community, and education.** You can learn more about my professional focus areas [on my website](https://samweaver.com/work/)!

I try to contribute back to open source (usually in the form of issues, bug reports, and documentation) to the projects I use when I can. Feel free to reach out to me via [my website](https://samweaver.com/me/) (look for the link that reads "Get in touch").

I currently maintain:
- [relaypro-open/YarnRunner-Python](https://github.com/relaypro-open/YarnRunner-Python) - A Python runner for compiled [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) story files.
- [relaypro-open/imetrics](https://github.com/relaypro-open/imetrics) - A lightweight Erlang application for gathering metrics. Provides a Prometheus-compatible API endpoint.
